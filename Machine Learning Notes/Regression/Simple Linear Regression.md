Simple Linear Regression (SRL) is the most simple bare basic form of linear regression. It is simple as it only looks at one independent variable and one dependent variable.

It looks to estimate a relationship between two continuous variables by fitting a linear relationship to the data.
The equation for simple linear regression is simply the equation of a line:

$$ \text{Simple Linear Regression Equation:} \\  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon $$

Where:
- (Y) is the dependent/target variable.
- (X_1, X_2, ... , X_n) are the independent variables/ features.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.
- (beta_1, beta_2, ... , beta_n) are the coefficients for each \( X \) variable. 

The goal of linear regression is to estimate the values for the beta_0 and beta_1 that minimise the sum of the squared differences
