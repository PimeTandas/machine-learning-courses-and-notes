In short artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of study that looks at machines ability to perform tasks often believed to be reserved for human minds, tasks such as:
- Perceiving 
- Predicting 
- Reasoning 
- Learning 
- Problem Solving
- And even creativity

The this is the most common and straight forward definition of AI

> "The Simulation of the Human Intelligence process by machines."

There are considered two types of AI.
1. Weak/ Narrow AI - Trained to focus on specific tasks.
2. Strong/ Artificial General Intelligence - This is still a theoretical form of AI where machines have general intelligence on par with humans, and can perform tasks ranging from, problem solving to emotions and planning for the future.

For the most part my study will be into narrow AI as AGI is still theoretical and very research heavy.

AI is a huge field that encompass many areas filled with different techniques and algorithms encompassed by more subfields. Some of the many subfields contained within the AI hierarchy are:
- <b><u>Machine Learning (ML)</u></b>:
	- ML involves many different algorithms that learn from or make predictions based on data. This subfield can yet be split further again:
		- Supervised Machine Learning
		- Unsupervised Machine Learning
		- Reinforcement Learning
		
- <b><u>Deep Learning</u></b>:
	- Deep learning is actually a subfield of ML which involves using neural networks, stacked deeply (more than 3 layers deep, including the input and output layer).
	- Deep Learning also automate the feature extraction process eliminating the need for a lot of human intervention meaning it works great for larger datasets.
- <b><u>Natural Language Processing (NPL)</u></b>:
- <b><u>Robotics</u></b>:
- <b><u>Expert Systems</u></b>:
- <b><u>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</u></b>:
